# Overview

This project provides a Python package for exploring **FBI crime data and divorce statistics** by state.\
It includes a **Streamlit app** for interactive visualization and tools for data wrangling.

Key features:

-   Load and clean FBI crime and divorce data
-   Visualize crime trends over time
-   Compare crime vs divorce rates
-   Interactive dashboard via Streamlit

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Installation

You can install the package from PyPI:

``` bash
pip install stat386-finalproject-divorce-crime
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Run

You can run the streamlit app by running this in the terminal:

``` bash
streamlit run src/stat386_finalproject_divorce_crime/app.py
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Interacting with Data

On the left sidebar of the streamlit app, there are a couple drop downs. Select a state from the state dropdown to compare different states.

Select the crime you wish to see.

Select whether to look at actual data (i.e. number of homicides) vs rates of crime per capita

After making your selection, streamlit will automatically make the necessary adjustments to the graph.

# Functions

-   load_data(file_name:str \| Path) -\> pd.DataFrame : this function takes in a string or path object as a parameter, and returns the corresponding datafile at that file location. You may need to play with the relative pathing. Data files will be located in Stat386-FinalProject-Divorce-Crime/src/data/\*
