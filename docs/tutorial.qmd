# Running the Streamlit App

The easiest way to explore the data is through the Streamlit app. You can access it by running the following in a terminal.

``` bash
streamlit run src/stat386_finalproject_divorce_crime/app.py
```

This launches an interactive dashboard in your browser.

# See the affect of Rape on Marriage Statistics in Kansas

Make sure the following are selected

- State
- Line
- Marriage
- Actual
- Rape
- Kansas

Note the peaks and valleys of each. Do they align? Or do they seem to be inversely related?

# See the affect of Motor Vehicle Theft Rates on Divorce Rates at the national level

Make sure the following are selected
- National
- Line
- Divorce
- Rate
- Motor Vehicle Theft

You should see that as motor vehicle theft has increased from year to year, divorce rate has decreased over the same time period.

# See the summary stats of linear regression models

- Check the box for "Show Regression Model"
- Select a crime
- Select a metric
- Select Divorce
- Select a model
  - Crime as a function of marriage and divorce
  - Marriage as a function of crime
  - Divorce as a function of crime

Note the R^2 of the model you chose. Also note the coefficients for all variables. Which are positively correlated and which are negatively correlated?

# Explore on your own

Try playing with all the parameters in the left sidebar on your own. Try to find any correlation (positive or negative) between crime and marriage and divorce.
