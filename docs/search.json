    "text": "2.1 Crime as the Outcome\nWe first modeled each violent crime rate as a function of marriage and divorce rates, controlling for state and year fixed effects:\n\\[\n\\text{CrimeRate}_{st} = \\beta_1\\text{MarriageRate}_{st} + \\beta_2\\text{DivorceRate}_{st} + \\text{FixedEffect:State}_s + \\text{FixedEffect:Year}_t + \\epsilon_{st}\n\\]\nThese regressions suggested that divorce rates are more strongly associated with violent crime rates than marriage rate. Additionally we very large coefficient of determinations from Burglary, Larsony, and Rape."

The inclusion of state and year fixed effects reduced coefficient magnitudes, showing that much of the raw correlation arises from persstent cross-state differences rather than shor-term fluctuations."
